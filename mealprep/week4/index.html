                        <p>
                          This week I decided I would take on making a coconut curry lentil stew with cilantro white rice for dinner
                          and chicken curry salad for lunch (because you can never have enough curry!). In addition, because 'tis the 
                          season, I also made pumpkin-spiced bread rolls.

                          <br />
                          <br />
                          <h2> Coconut Curry Lentils </h2>
                          <p> For the coconut curry lentils, you'll need two onions (one red, one white), 2 cloves of fresh garlic, 2 cups of lentils, 1 sweet potato, 4 carrots, 3 tbsp curry powder, .5 tsp of ground cloves, 6 roma tomatoes, 1 15oz can tomato sauce (I get Trader Joe's fire roasted with green chiles), 3 cups of vegetable broth (I used three cubes), 1 can coconut milk, 3 cups [dry] white rice (6 cups cooked), and green onion/cilantro to  taste </p>
                          <br />
                          <img src="https://github.com/underwriteyourlife/underwritelife/blob/master/img/common/mealprep/week4/coconutlentils/Coconut%20Lentils%20Ingredients.jpg?raw=true" height="650" width="450"/>
                          <br />
	   <p>Dice all the ingredients before beginning. </p>

				 <p> Get out a big pot: sautee the garlic, white onion, and carrots for about 3 minutes. Add the diced roma tomatoes, sweet potato. Cook for another 3-5 minutes. Then add the canned tomato, spices, broth (or broth cubes), and lentils [this should be all the ingredients except for coconut milk, red onion, and green onion/cilantro]. Let this simmer and cook for 1-2 hours. In the meantime, cook the rice to make about 6 cups of white rice. Once the lentils have stewed until soft, add the coconut milk and stir until thickened. Serve 1.5 cups of lentils over 1 cup of white rice, topped with your preference of toppings. </p>

                          <br />
                          <h2 Chicken Curry Salad </h2>
                          <p> For the chicken curry salad, you'll need 4 tbsp mayonnaise, 4 tbsp plain yogurt, .5 lemon, 1 tbsp honey, 1 tsp curry powder, salt/pepper to taste, 2 pounds chicken (uncooked), 4 stalks celery, .5 cup raisins, 1 red onion, 1 apple,
                          and green onion to taste. </p>
                          <br />
                          <br />                          
                          <img src="INSERT ALL INGREDIENTS HERE"/>
                          <p> Cook the chicken according to your personal preference. While the chicken is cooking, dice the other
                          ingredients. Squeeze the juice of 1/4th lemon over the diced apple (this helps prevent browning). Then mix 
                          the liquid ingredients together to create a sauce. Once the chicken is cooked and cooled, mix all the 
                          ingredients together and serve with chips. 
                          </p>
                          <br />
                          <br />
                          <h2> Pumpkin Rolls </h2>
                          <p> This one was more of a wild card but ended up suprisingly delicious. I dissolved 1 packet yeast in .5 cup
                          of warm water, with 1 tbsp sugar. I melted 2 tbsp butter and 3 tbsp Trader Joes pumpkin spice cream cheese
                          together, then added this to the yeast along with 3 tbsp more sugar as well as 2 eggs. Lastly, I added .5 cups of pureed pumpkin (non-spiced). I mixed these together and added cinnamon/nutmeg/sugar to taste. To finish up, I added a pinch of salt and slowly kneaded 3 cups of flour into the mixture, until it was soft but did not
                          stick to my hands or the surface. I let this rest for 1 hour before pulling it apart into little balls and 
                          baking at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. They are delicious!
